# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: From my understanding JSX is a mix of HTML and Javascript. JSX is a extension of Javascript.

Researched answer: JSX is a extension of Javascript that gives a way to use component rendering using syntax similar to HTML. JSX gives the ability to write HTML elements in Javascript. One syntax difference is in HMTL <div></div> is used and in JSX fragments 
<></> are used.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: I don't recall from my own knowledge what is yarn or what files are modified in a React application when the command yarn is ran in terminal.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for Node.js. Originally created to address issues with the NPM package manager built by Meta.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: React components returns the value of JSX. In order to run a component call needs to be made. Also needs to have a self closing tag.

Researched answer: A React component is a specific type of funciton containing Javascript logic and the return gets shown in the browser. In React, Functional components are used which are composed of Javascript functions.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values determines behavior and Props take information to other components.

Researched answer: The difference between state values and props in React are, state values are decbribed as special variables that store data and determine the behavior of the component. Components can either hold state or not hold state. As for props, they are objects used in React to pass information from component to component. They have unidirectional flow from the parent component to nested components. Also have a "read only" value.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM is what you see when a website pulls up in a browser.

Researched answer: DOM is a visual reflection of the code. DOM also stands for Document Obect Model. In React, Virtual DOM is the key. The DOM changes a particular piece of the page and updates only the piece that has changed. For example, if someone likes a post on social media the virtual DOM reacts and the like button is now engaged.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div divides content of the page and from my knowledge not entirely sure about span.

Researched answer: A div or Division tag used in HTML to divide content on the web page(text, images, header,etc.). Div has both opening and closing tags. A span from my research is a inline container for inline elements. Groups elements for styling by using class or id attributes.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects rather than functions and logic.

2. Ruby: dynamic, open source programming language that focuses on simplicity plus productivity.

3. Implicit return: funciton that returns values without using return as a keyword.

4. Ruby blocks: lines of code that you put inside the do and end keywords.

5. Ruby hashes: a data structure that is used to store data in unique key value pairs.
